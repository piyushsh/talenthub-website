            <h1>Scholarship Process Help</h1>
            <p>
                Student athletes, it is advised that you pay careful attention to this Scholarship Process Help page as the information provided here can be very important for you as you seek to study in the United States.

                <li><strong>College Admission Test:</strong>
                    <p>In order to enrol into an American College or University, and to get awarded a sport scholarship, you will have to have written and passed your SAT test.</p>
                    <p>The SAT is a globally recognized college admission test that lets you show colleges what you know and how well you can apply that knowledge. It tests your knowledge of reading, writing and math — subjects that are taught every day in high school classrooms. SAT scores help universities make informed admission decisions by providing one indicator of your academic readiness to do university-level work.</p>
                    <p>Good news: the SAT test is administered in over 175 countries, which means no matter what country you are in, you will most likely be able to write this test that is integral to your dreams of studying in the United States.</p>
                    <p>It is not ALL colleges or universities in the United States that require you to have written and passed an SAT examination, however - even if a university does not require SAT Subject Tests, the SAT examination can help you stand out in the admission process and demonstrate readiness for specific majors or programs in college (when considering Subject Tests, you should particularly consider subject areas that you like or in which you excel).  Many four-year colleges or university in the United States requires a standardized entrance exam as part of the admission process. Most selective universities require or recommend a test with writing, like the SAT, and most highly selective universities also require SAT Subject Tests.</p>
                    <p>The best way to get ready for the SAT is to familiarize yourself with the SAT so you know what to expect on test day. Sample SAT questions, a full-length practice test, and many other resources are available on Talenthub, email <a href="mailto:sat@talenthubapp.com">sat@talenthubapp.com</a> for sample practice questions, and the official SAT Study Guide with DVD. We advise you to buy your SAT book and test preparation material long before you book your test, so as to give yourself enough time to study and prepare for your test.  For international students, it’s important to take the exams within two years before you expect to enter college. They’re offered to international students six times throughout the year in October, November, December, January, May and June. If your chosen colleges ask for SAT Subject Tests, you will need to register for these in a separate transaction from your SAT registration. Also, be aware that SAT Subject Tests cannot be taken on the same day as the longer SAT. If you have any confusion with this, please contact <a href="mailto:sat@talenthubapp.com">sat@talenthubapp.com</a> and ask for assistance.</p>
                    <p>If you are one year away from when you expect to enter college, make sure to register for the SAT no later than the November before you plan to start university and also give yourself enough time to prepare for the test. Most students take the SAT once or twice; taking the SAT more than twice is not recommended because it does not commonly affect scores significantly. This will be enough material and preparation time to get you well prepared for your big test.</p>

                    <p>Now that you know what the SAT test is, and you know what you need to best prepare for it - after contacting <a href="mailto:sat@talenthubapp.com">sat@talenthubapp.com</a>  and purchasing your study material, you will be ready to apply online to write your SAT test.
