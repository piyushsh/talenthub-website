            <h1>Professional Process Help</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents and Scouts:
                    <p>Talenthub has an abounding database of professional sport agents that can help you with professional sport opportunities.</p>
                    <p>We have a system in place to verify these agents, and any scouts who are on the platform, so we encourage sport talent on Talenthub to be very careful when dealing with unverified agents or scouts.</p>
                    <p>We are not saying that they are illegitimate, we are in the process of verifying them so many agents and scouts will be unverified at this moment – we will update this information when all legitimate agents are expected to be verified. For now, just be careful when dealing with any agent on Talenthub.</p>
                    <p>The Talenthub philosophy is that you should be able to chase your dreams for as low a price as possible – so, at this moment, our policy is that no agent or scout should request money from any sport talent on our platform, unless the situation is fitting – if an agent or scout asks you for money on Talenthub and you are not sure whether the situation is fitting or not and you want advise on this matter – please contact legal@talenthubapp.com with your question, we will give you an answer in advice that you do not have to take. There are a lot of agents and scouts who cheat young aspiring professional sports talent of their money, we just want to protect you, where and when we can from this.</p>
                    <p>When an agent is verified, they will have a verified symbol next to their profile pictures, at all times. The verified symbol will be on the border of their profile picture.</p>
                    <p>So, remember:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If an agent or scout asks you for money on our platform, don’t respond to them immediately. First email us at <a href="mailto:legal@talenthubapp.com">legal@talenthubapp.com</a> with the situation you are in with that agent/scout (how long you have been talking to them, what exactly is your arrangement/what have you talked about), tell us what they want the money for (what are they saying they will do with the money/what are you paying for) – we will reply as soon as possible and advise you on what we, from our experience, is legit or not, and what we advise you to do in terms of your reply to that agent or scout.</li>
                    </ul>

                    </p>
                </li>

                    VISA Information:
                    <p>Unless you are a citizen of a European Union member state and are travelling to a professional sport opportunity in another European Union member state, you will need a sport visa (recommended) or any type of visa that will get you in that country legally for the purpose of a professional sport opportunity.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you ask the agent or scout that you are dealing with for help in this section. They are likely to have been in this situation before and may know exactly what you need to apply for in terms of visas.</p>
                    <p>If the agent or scout do not know what type of visa you may need, you can go onto www.projectvisa.com to learn of the type of visa you will need for the country you wish to pursue professional sport opportunities in.</p>
                    <p>If you are still not satisfied, or have found www.projectvisa.com to be difficult to use – please email visa@talenthubapp.com and provide the following details:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your  Talenthub personal details</li>
                        <li>Your nationality</li>
                        <li>Your sport</li>
                        <li>The Talenthub details of the agent/scout you have been talking to</li>
                        <li>The full details of your arrangement and agreement with that agent/scout</li>
                        <li>The country you wish to travel to for your professional sport opportunity</li>
                        <li>The length of time you need to be in that country for your professional sport opportunity</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We will then get back to you as soon as possible with the type of visa you will need for the country you will be going to.</p>
                    <p>Below we have listed some Frequently Asked Questions on visas.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What is a Visa?</strong>
                            <p>A visa is a sticker or stamp that is placed in your passport to allow you to enter the country that has issued it. Without a visa for some countries there is no way you can enter legally.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Why do I need a visa to enter a country?</strong>
                            <p>The countries that make you get a visa do this to protect their country from undesirables (people who are a threat to the peace in a country, in any way).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>What do I need to get a visa?</strong>
                            <p>In general you will need:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A passport with at least six months validity left on it.</li>
                                <li>An application form that is filled out with all sorts of information.</li>
                                <li>Two Passport photos – we recommend you have a minimum of six, just in case that country you are going to wants more than two.</li>
                                <li>Visa registration/collection fee.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Where do I get a visa?</strong>
                            <p>Generally, you can get a visa from the representative of the country you wish to visit. It is usually the consulate, embassy or mission. Sometimes, you can get your visa upon arrival at that country. It totally depends on that specific country – check this on the countries visas website.</p>
